# CS230

The Gaming Room is developing a web-based version of their Android game, Draw It or Lose It, to make it accessible across multiple devices. They required a scalable, secure system architecture with support for multiple teams and players, unique naming conventions, and a single game instance running at a time.

The documentation clearly lays out the design constraints, including the Singleton pattern for game management and scalability considerations. I also effectively detailed the platform evaluation and recommendations for a Linux-based cloud solution with microservices architecture.

The process of outlining the software architecture, evaluating the platforms, and defining the design constraints helped in clearly envisioning how different components would interact and in making informed decisions during the coding phase.

I would refine the section above the Evaluation, elaborating more on design constraints as some additional or others may be better suited for the project.

I interpreted the userâ€™s need for a web-based, multi-platform system with team and player management by focusing on scalability and security. It's crucial to prioritize user needs to ensure the application meets functional requirements while providing a seamless user experience.

For future projects, I would use UML diagrams and sequence diagrams early in the design phase. This would provide a better view of how different subsystems interact, making it easier to foresee potential issues.
